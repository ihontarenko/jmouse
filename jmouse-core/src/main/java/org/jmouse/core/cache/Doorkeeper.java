/**
 * üö™ <b>Doorkeeper</b>: a tiny Bloom-like front filter for TinyLFU.
 *
 * <p>The doorkeeper suppresses one-hit noise before it reaches the frequency sketch (e.g., CMS).
 * On the <b>first</b> sighting of a key, it sets {@code numberOfHashes} bits and returns {@code false}
 * (meaning: ‚Äúdo not count yet‚Äù). On the <b>second and subsequent</b> sightings, those bits are already set
 * and it returns {@code true} (meaning: ‚Äúconsider this a repeated key; allow counting‚Äù).</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why 2 hash functions by default?</h3>
 * Using {@code k=2} bits is a strong practical sweet spot for false-positive rate (FP) vs. cost.
 * The FP probability for a Bloom-like filter is approximately:
 * <pre>
 * p_fp ‚âà (1 - e^{-k¬∑n/m})^k
 * </pre>
 * where {@code m} is the number of bits in the filter, {@code k} is the number of hash functions,
 * and {@code n} is the number of distinct keys observed since the last {@link #reset()}.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code k=1}: cheaper but significantly higher FP.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code k=2}</b>: large FP drop for very small extra cost (two bit writes on first sighting).</li>
 *   <li>{@code k>2}: sometimes marginal FP gains, but higher CPU and not always beneficial unless {@code m/n} is large.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Epoch semantics</h3>
 * Calling {@link #reset()} clears all bits, starting a new ‚Äúepoch‚Äù. This intentionally forgets earlier
 * first sightings so popularity is measured over recent history.
 *
 * <h3>Complexity</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #admit(Object)}: O(k) bit lookups (and O(k) bit sets on first sight).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #reset()}: O(m) to clear, implemented via {@link BitSet#clear()} (efficient native path).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Thread-safety</h3>
 * Not thread-safe. Guard with external synchronization or shard per thread/core.
